# World-Cup-EDA-using-SQL
Another interesting challenge. We all love football/soccer. This is a dataset you finish interacting with and you would have known more about FIFA World Cups..

How comfortable are you finding numbers and trends
hidden away in a dataset? Let's find the following:

- How many matches were played each world cup year
from 1930.

- Total goals scored for each tournament year.

- All teams who have reached finals and how many
times.

- All teams who have reached semis and how many
times.

- How many goals and average goals scored in all
semi-finals.

- How many goals and average goals scored in all
quarter-finals.

- How many goals and average number scored in all
finals

- How many matches were played outside quarter-
finals and above.

The #kicker:

- Two new columns for each of the outcome of every
match stating:

a. outcome = D for Draw, A for AwayTeam Wins, H for
HomeTeam wins.

b. Winner of each game: 'Draw' if no winner.

PS: Assume the AwayGoal advantage.
